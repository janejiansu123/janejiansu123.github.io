## Jane's Experience in Sewing...
is zero! She is a senior Theater and Art Practice + History major, with a certificate in German. She has taken CS136 at Williams and learned Arduino and Python in high school. She hopes to have fun with the class at a TA! Boring fact: she likes seaweed snacks with oreo.
